# Orbit-s-Planets-around-the-Sun
This python's project is a code that simulate the orbit of one or two planets around an other object (in this case, the Sun). 



Start introducing the three object you want to know (two around one, it means that one of them doesn't move). Write them mass, how many days you want to count and what gap of time of the steps. At the end, introduce their initial positions

By this project, you'll know, for example, what type of orbit planets do around the Sun; Which conditions this orbit converges; You can simulate a meteor interaction with the Sun and a planet, and know how it'll act and so much more.


Enjoy the code, though it's simple, fell free to improve it.
